# RagTab
An open-source alternative to the Momentum new tab page.

# Why does this exist?
- I was bored
- Edge randomly removed Momentum from my computer.
- I was tired of Momentum nagging me to upgrade.
- I wanted a new-tab page that could use my To-Do list

# Why isn't the to-do list fully open-source?
If I didn't keep my PHP private, my friends would immediately find a way to break it. I will probably add a config file with the ability to set the to-do list to whatever you want in a future update. The to do list widget can be pointed at a different webpage or disabled completely in config.js if you don't like it.

# Can I use my own background images?
I will probably make that configurable in the future.
